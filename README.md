## Linear correlation coefficient

The linear correlation coefficient is a number calculated from given data that measures the strength of the linear relationship between two datasets: x and y. The sign of the linear correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the linear relationship between x and y. When r (the correlation coefficient) is near 1 or âˆ’1, the linear relationship is strong; when it is near 0, the linear relationship is weak.

<!-- $$
r = \frac{n \cdot \sum{xy} - \sum{x} \cdot \sum{y}}{\sqrt{n \cdot \sum{x^2} - (\sum{x})^2} \cdot \sqrt{n \cdot \sum{y^2} - (\sum{y})^2}}

Where:
- r - linear correlation coefficient;
- n - number of pairs in dataset;
- x,y - datasets.
